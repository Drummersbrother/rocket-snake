The Exceptions
==============

This module (``rocket_snake.exceptions``) defines the exceptions that are specific to Rocket Snake.
All of them are subclasses of some ``builtins`` exception, but not all of them are direct subclasses.

.. class:: exceptions.NoAPIKeyError
A subclass of :class:`ValueError`, and is raised when an API key isn't provided to the :class:`RLS_Client`.

.. class:: exceptions.APIServerError
A subclass of :class:`ConnectionError`, and is raised when the client gets an error when trying to request something
from the API server.

.. class:: exceptions.APINotFoundError
A subclass of :class:`ConnectionError`, and is raised when the API server can't find what was requested
(e.g. if a player with the requested displayname doesn't exists)

.. class:: exceptions.APIBadResponseCodeError
A subclass of :class:`ConnectionError`, and is raised when the API returns a response code that isn't successful,
but can't be identified as a more specific error.

.. class:: exceptions.RatelimitError
A subclass of :class:`APIBadResponseCodeError`, and is raised when the :class:`RLS_Client` gets ratelimited by the API
server but didn't handle ratelimiting at all or not properly.

.. class:: exceptions.InvalidAPIKeyError
A subclass of :class:`APIBadResponseCodeError`, and is raised when the :class:`RLS_Client` has been initialised with
an invalid API key and tries to execute a request to the API server.
